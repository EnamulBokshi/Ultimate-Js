/*
When a user clicks a button, scrolls, or simply moves the mouse within a web page, that action creates an event. 
An event is the browser's way of notifying your JavaScript code that something has happened.
JavaScript allows you to respond to these events using event listeners.
This is a powerful feature that enables you to create interactive web applications.
Event listeners are functions that are executed when a specific event occurs.

Why it's called event listeners?
Well, the name is a bit misleading.
Event listeners are not actually listening for events.
Instead, they are waiting for events to occur.
When an event occurs, the event listener is executed.
Event listeners are functions that are executed when a specific event occurs.

Events are how the browser tells JavaScript that something has occurred in the DOM. It's almost as if every time the mouse moves, the browser is saying "Hey JavaScript, the mouse just moved!", or a key is pressed, the browser is shouting, "Hey, the user just pressed a key!".
Thse shouts are called events and it's happeing all the time. Our script code can respond to them using event listeners.
like this:
 if mouse moves do that, if button is clicked do this, if a key is pressed do that.
